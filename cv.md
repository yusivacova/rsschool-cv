## About me

I am 26 years old. My education is legal. I have experience in legal public and private organizations.

During my studies and work, I learned to read. It is to read the documentation from beginning to end. I think this is a very good quality that will be useful to me in my new profession. I am also a hardworking worker, responsive and a team player. I am also ready to receive knowledge, even if it will be difficult.

I don't have professional experience in programming. I am just starting my way in this field.

I also try to improve my English language skills.

I will try to study and study until I achieve my goal.
